#the factors are use for category 
#create of a factor
#example
v = c('M', 'm','m', 'g', 's', 'S')
factor(v) #organize of the vector in category

#Note: Character vector
character(length = 4) #create 4 space for characters
as.character(2) #convert in the character
is.character(a) #see if is a character  

#create a factor
a = c(2, 4, 1, 3)
